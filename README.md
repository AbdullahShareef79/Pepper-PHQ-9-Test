# PHQ-9 Test on Pepper Robot 2.9

This application is designed to implement a study on Pepper Robot 2.9 to perform the PHQ-9 test, a validated questionnaire used for assessing mental health and screening for depression. The project uses a structured conversational approach to administer the test interactively.

## Project Overview
This project enables Pepper Robot to conduct the PHQ-9 test through voice and screen-based interactions. The application ensures a seamless and engaging experience, making it accessible and non-intimidating for users. By leveraging Pepper’s advanced capabilities, this implementation aims to improve the efficiency of mental health assessments.

## Features
- **PHQ-9 Questionnaire Automation**: Pepper administers the test questions verbally and collects responses.
- **Interactive Input Options**: Users can respond using speech or touch-based inputs on Pepper’s tablet.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Pepper provides tailored responses based on user answers.
- **Multilingual Support**: Administers the PHQ-9 test in multiple languages, catering to diverse populations.
- **Results Calculation**: Automatically calculates the PHQ-9 score and provides insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Pepper Robot SDK 2.9**: Core development platform for Pepper Robot.
- **Java**: Programming language used for implementing the application.
- **Android Studio**: Development environment for building and testing the project.
- **QiChat**: Dialogue management for smooth conversational flow.

## How It Works
1. **Introduction**: Pepper introduces the purpose of the PHQ-9 test and provides a brief overview.
2. **Questionnaire**: Pepper asks each question from the PHQ-9 test interactively, recording user responses.
3. **Scoring**: The application calculates the total score based on the user’s responses.
4. **Feedback**: Pepper provides the results, including next steps or recommendations if required.
